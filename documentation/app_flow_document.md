# App Flow Document for Gober API

## Introduction

This document describes the complete user journey and all API interactions for the Gober API, a scalable backend built with FastAPI. The core purpose of Gober API is to manage users, tender listings, and personalized search criteria while efficiently handling long-running asynchronous tasks such as generating AI summaries and documents. Built with security, performance, and modularity in mind, the API supports both standard user management and advanced asynchronous processing using Gemini for language model integrations. This document explains every page and API endpoint interaction in clear, everyday language, ensuring that every step of the journey is fully connected and easily understood.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a user first interacts with the Gober API, they begin with the authentication process. New users discover the API either through a dedicated landing page of the web application that consumes the API or a direct API call provided by documentation such as Swagger/OpenAPI. To register, the user sends his or her credentials to the POST /api/auth/signup endpoint. Once enrolled, the user then authenticates using the POST /api/auth/login endpoint which, if the credentials are valid, provides a JWT token for secure session management. In case a user has forgotten their password, the API offers a password update mechanism through the PUT /api/auth/password endpoint, ensuring that account recovery or maintenance is both straightforward and secure. Additionally, there is an endpoint for POST /api/auth/logout to allow users to securely end their session. Although the system currently supports a simple role structure for demo purposes, robust logging and error reporting have been implemented to support future expanded functionalities.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, the user is conceptually directed to the main dashboard. In a client application that consumes this API, the dashboard typically presents the core modules that the API supports. These include an overview of user account details (such as session status and options for updating passwords), a list of tenders available for interaction with features for filtering, sorting, and pagination, and shortcuts to manage saved tenders and search criteria. The dashboard serves as the central hub where actions such as listing users, managing tenders, or initiating asynchronous operations are naturally accessible. Although the Gober API is a backend service, its endpoints are designed to integrate seamlessly into any front-end interface following this logical layout.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After logging in, users are routed to the tender management section. Here, the API’s GET /api/tenders endpoint allows users to retrieve a list of available tenders with built-in support for filtering, sorting, and pagination. When a user selects a specific tender, that action triggers a call to GET /api/tenders/:id, which returns detailed information about that tender. At this stage, the application offers additional interactive functionalities. Users can save or unsave tenders by invoking the POST /api/tenders/:id/save endpoint, while also having access to their personalized list through GET /api/tenders/saved. For further customization, users can define or update their saved search criteria by using GET and PUT requests on the /api/search-criteria endpoint. An endpoint like GET /api/tender-types supplies users with current tender type options to further refine their application experience.

A critical feature of the system is the management of asynchronous operations, particularly for tasks involving AI-driven summaries and document generation. When a user requests an AI summary or document update on a tender, they trigger the respective endpoint – either PUT /api/tenders/:id/ai-summary or PUT /api/tenders/:id/ai-document. These calls initiate long-running asynchronous tasks that may involve multiple interactions with internal APIs calling the Gemini language model. The design ensures that these operations are carried out in the background while the API continues to serve immediate responses and maintain a responsive system. Throughout these transitions, the system's modular architecture ensures that users move seamlessly from tender exploration to initiating task processing without interruption.

## Settings and Account Management

The API provides robust endpoints for account management and settings adjustments. Users can always manage their personal information and update their credentials securely via the designated endpoints (such as POST /api/auth/signup for new registrations, POST /api/auth/login for sign-ins, and PUT /api/auth/password for password updates). In addition to these essential controls, clients who integrate the API can design settings interfaces that allow users to adjust preferences related to notifications and saved search parameters. The endpoints in the search criteria module (GET and PUT /api/search-criteria) enable users not only to retrieve existing criteria but also update them as their preferences change. Once adjustments are made, the user can return to the main dashboard or resume interacting with the tender management features, ensuring that the entire experience is both dynamic and user-friendly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Robust error handling is integrated into every endpoint of the Gober API. When users enter invalid data, such as incorrect login credentials or invalid parameters in tender filtering, the system responds with meaningful error messages and status codes that explain what went wrong. For example, if authentication fails during login, the API returns an error indicating invalid credentials, while any failed request for updating information is captured by detailed logging systems. In the event of connectivity issues or processing delays during asynchronous tasks, fallback mechanisms ensure that the system remains responsive. The API’s logging and monitoring tools continuously capture these errors, and detailed reports aid the support teams in debugging and maintaining high performance. Alternate paths such as password recovery or retrying asynchronous operations are available, ensuring that users are guided back to a normal operation flow even when encountering errors.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey through Gober API begins with a straightforward registration and login process, allowing users to obtain secure access via JWT authentication. From there, every interaction—from browsing through a list of tenders, selecting detailed tender information, and saving individual tenders, to customizing search criteria and initiating AI-driven processes—has been designed to be seamless and user-oriented. The modular design not only supports effective user management and tender interactions but also integrates long-running asynchronous operations without sacrificing API responsiveness. Moreover, robust error handling, detailed logging, and performance monitoring provide a safety net for smooth operation, while a clear separation of deployment environments (development, staging, production) and support for CI/CD pipelines ensure that the entire system is built for future scalability. In essence, the complete journey provided by Gober API takes the user from initial authentication to everyday task completion with confidence in security, efficiency, and seamless usability.
