# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

The Gober API project is designed to serve as a robust and scalable backend for managing users, tenders, and customized search criteria. Built on FastAPI using Python, the API not only secures user authentication with JWT and password encryption but also orchestrates complex operations such as asynchronous tasks involving AI processes. This document explains in everyday language why we chose each technology, from the core backend framework to deployment practices, ensuring that every stakeholder understands how each component contributes to a reliable and high-performing service.

## Frontend Technologies

Although the primary focus of the Gober API is the backend, the system is designed to be easily consumed by a modern web application. In this context, tools like V0 by Vercel are referenced as a way to build frontend components with modern design patterns. These tools allow the frontend to interact seamlessly with our API by utilizing auto-generated documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) provided by FastAPI. Additionally, Cursor has been incorporated as an advanced IDE that offers real-time suggestions, helping developers integrate frontend components with the robust backend while following best practices in code styling and design.

## Backend Technologies

The core of our system is built with FastAPI, a Python framework known for its high performance and ease of creating RESTful services. Python serves as the runtime language, providing simplicity and efficiency in writing asynchronous functions to handle long-running tasks without degrading service responsiveness. The API integrates two distinct types of databases. Azure SQL Database is used for storing relational data, ensuring that user information and transactional data are managed securely and efficiently. In parallel, Amazon Neptune is chosen to serve as our graph database, allowing us to manage complex relationships, such as associations between clients and tenders, with high performance. An additional boost in discovery and filtering capabilities is provided by MeiliSearch Cloud, which acts as our search engine making it simple and quick to query tender data.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To ensure that the Gober API is always available, reliable, and scalable, we have adopted a modern infrastructure strategy. The entire application is containerized using Docker, enabling a predictable environment from local development to production. We have designed the system to support separate environments for development, staging, and production, which minimizes the risk of configuration conflicts and makes testing easier. Azure DevOps is used to handle our continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, ensuring that every change is thoroughly tested and seamlessly deployed. This approach allows us to maintain consistent quality across all releases and quickly adopt new updates or features without downtime.

## Third-Party Integrations

The API incorporates several third-party services that enhance functionality and ease of integration. For handling asynchronous operations, especially those involving AI processes, the system interacts with internal APIs that subsequently call the Gemini language model. This hybrid method enables the application to perform complex document or summary generation tasks while keeping the API responsive. In addition, advanced AI tools like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Deepseek R1, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are integrated into the development and code review process, providing intelligent suggestions that streamline the coding effort. Furthermore, robust logging, monitoring, and error reporting systems are in place to capture significant events, troubleshoot issues, and track performance in real time, ensuring that any integration issues are quickly identified and resolved.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a paramount concern throughout the Gober API project. The API uses JWT for secure user authentication, ensuring that each request comes from a verified source. Password encryption provides an extra layer of data protection, safeguarding sensitive user information. We have also implemented robust logging, monitoring, and error reporting systems which not only help in keeping track of system activities but also play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating cyber threats and potential breaches. On the performance front, the API is optimized to support intensive asynchronous operations. This includes simple caching strategies and rate limiting mechanisms to maintain a smooth user experience even during heavy loads. These measures, combined with FastAPI's inherent efficiency, help ensure that backend operations remain both secure and responsive.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technology choices made for the Gober API are a direct reflection of the project’s need for a secure, high-performing, and scalable system. At its core, Python and FastAPI provide a modern framework that balances performance with developer productivity. Integration with Azure SQL Database, Amazon Neptune, and MeiliSearch Cloud ensures that our data is stored, managed, and retrieved efficiently across different types of operations. The infrastructure choices such as Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines powered by Azure DevOps facilitate smooth deployment and maintenance across multiple environments. Moreover, third-party integrations with advanced AI tools and robust logging systems underscore our commitment to a secure and well-monitored API. This comprehensive tech stack not only meets the project’s current demo-phase needs but also provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability.
